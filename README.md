    CREATE TABLE departures (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        departure_time TIME NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE routes (
        id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        departure_time TIME NOT NULL,
        station_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        line_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        sequence_number INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        CONSTRAINT routes_stations_id_fk FOREIGN KEY (station_id) REFERENCES stations (id),
        CONSTRAINT routes_lines_id_fk FOREIGN KEY (line_id) REFERENCES `lines` (id)
    );

    INSERT INTO `lines` (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Kesklinn-JÃ¼ri');
    INSERT INTO routes (id, departure_time, station_id, line_id, sequence_number) VALUES (1, '11:42:15', 1, 1, 1);
